These are some websites I made for fun while learning Web Dev :)
Hope you like them!

MySpace: https://hassaan1shakil.github.io/Web-Apps-For-Fun/MySpace/
This is the first website that I made. It is dedicated to Tom Anderson, the creator of MySpace.

Apple: https://hassaan1shakil.github.io/Web-Apps-For-Fun/Apple/
I have always adored the aesthetics and graphic design choices that Apple brings to the table. I'm really happy that this website turned out well.

Netflix: https://hassaan1shakil.github.io/Web-Apps-For-Fun/Netflix/
Polishing my skills even further with Netflix Home Page.
